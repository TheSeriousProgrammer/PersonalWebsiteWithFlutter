## Personal Website With Flutter

This is my personal website built with flutter to be hosted in github

## Why I built in flutter

I am not much of a frontend-dev , I know only flutter and lazy enough to learn other UI frameworks

## Navigating through source

The main branch of this repository holds the raw flutter src code, whereas
the release branch holds the complied code to be hosted in github pages

## TODO

Add blog feature
Add comments feature
